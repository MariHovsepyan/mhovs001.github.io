        <div class="subheading mb-5">English Student</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My work experience began in April 2022 when I began to work at Starbucks Corportation as a barista. I worked for Starbucks
        from April 2022 until November 2023. This job taught me many vital work skills that I have carried with me and I will continue to 
        use in my future professions, even in completely unrelated fields. I learned the importance of time management and how to multi task,
        crafting beverages while also planning out my next steps to ensure efficient task completion. Many times I was operating our POS by 
        taking orders through a headest as I was making drinks for the previous orders and grabbing food for cars waiting at the window. I 
        learned how to work well under pressure and the importance of balance. <br><br>

        In April 2023 I began working at my second job, L & S Tax and Accounting Inc. At this job, I performed typical office tasks and was my
        introduction to the professional work field. I was the personal assistant for Lusine, the accountant, and I would complete all types 
        of tasks for her. Majority of my time was spent answering phone calls, scheduling meetings, organizing paperwork, and completely 
        trivial paperwork. I learned how to be detail oriented and double check everything I was submitting, as these were important federal
        or state paperwork. I used my ability to work under stress at this job as I had many moments where multiasking was necessary and time
        senstivte deadlines were coming up. I left L & S tax and Accouning in July 2024.<br><br>

        My most recent job was at a small cafe called Love You Latte where I was employed from Novemeber 2024 to January 2025. I began working 
        here as I missed the feeling od connecting with people over something as simple as a cup of coffee. At this job, my expectations were 
        more then the barista title I had at Starbucks as I was expected to manage my fellow coworkers and deligate. I was also in charge of
        organizing and managing inventory and making sure we were set up for success at all times. I learned to be more assertive and was able
        to employ my previously aquired work skills at this job.
